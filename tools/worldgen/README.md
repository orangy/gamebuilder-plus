## Introduction
Hello! I go by Romans 8:28 in the Game Builder Discord and Steam forums, and I wanted to build upon the wonderful foundations that is Game Builder. 

There is so much we can already do in Game Builder, and the foundation continues to get laid as we are still in Early Access - but what I felt was lacking in the game is _terrain_. 

We have customizable characters and sounds and particles and a lot of freedom to really extend the game but our terrain looks like this.

![A little vanilla don't you think?](../../assets/worldgen/flat_terrain.png)

That's a little upsetting, well at least it was to me. Of course nothing on the developers who have put a lot of extra time into developing this game, but I wanted to give this terrain a little extra _zing_ to give it some life. This is where the idea being these world gen tools came into being.

<a id="internals"></a>
<a id="prework"></a>
### The pre-work

We can thank @steverock (Developer) for introducing the `simpleData` format in order for this world gen tool to be possible. The complete details can be found on a link on the <a href="https://orangy.github.io/gamebuilder-plus/index.html">website</a>, but I will briefly explain the timeline here.

In order to create worlds that Game Builder can load, it is necessary that we understand what format the game's maps are saved as. For Game Builder, the format of maps are `.voos` files, which is a made-up format specifically designed for Game Builder. A `.voos` file is really just a JSON object containing information about the entire map (_everything_ in the map). If you happen to look at a `.voos` file, you will see a lot of information - perhaps too much to handle! 

Within this `.voos` file is a key named **v2Data** which aptly stands for version 2 of the encoded map data. (Version 2 is the latest versioning as of this writing; the version may go up in the future.) When a new world is generated, the terrain data gets compressed and serialized to the string that's saved in **v2Data** in the `.voos` file.

![voosfile](../../assets/worldgen/voos_file.png)

If we could understand how the **v2Data** terrain data is encoded, we would be able to reverse-engineer code that would allow us to create our own `.voos` files with custom terrain. Sounds easy enough, right? (It was not).

I did my best looking around at the code and was making some progress, but the approach I was taking was going to be brittle in that if the Game Builder team changed terrain generation in any way, I'd have to re-write all of my code. It wasn't the ideal solution, so I asked the team and what we came up with was `simpleData`. 

The way `simpleData` works is that if a map contains `simpleData` when that map is loaded, the game will deserialize the data and create the terrain (as described). In more laymans-terms, this means we have all of our map data in `simpleData`, all the positions (x, y, z) and Blocks we want to place, and the game will unravel this for us and place the Blocks as we have told it to do.

More detail about `simpleData` can be found in the link above shared by Steve. If you want more detail, you can look in the source code to see how the world gen tool does this.

### Algorithms

The crux of world generation is an algorithm. What code or set of instructions can I tell a program to create for me a dynamic and natural looking world?

This question is a very hard one to ask, as there are lots of discussions around it and many different algorithms and combinations of algorithms to choose. When searching for an algorithm to use in the tool, I initially found the Diamond Square algorithm, but did not like the lack of variation I was finding when using it. I later found the Perlin Noise algorithm which I will briefly explain before going into how it is used in the world gen tool.

#### Perlin Noise algorithm
Perlin Noise is actually not an algorithm, but rather a function (it takes in inputs and returns an output) that returns a value within a given range. Depending on the implementation, the output value of Perlin Noise is from 0 to 1 [0, 1] or -1 to 1 [-1, 1].

To use Perlin Noise in terrain generation, and how I used it, is to put your x and y values into the function and save the output. The value of your output is the height of the terrain block that you will place in the map.

In a simple example, if we are generating the height of a terrain block at (x=2, z=3), we would put these inputs into the Perlin Noise function, and save the result into y.

```
y = PerlinNoise(x, z)
```

We take the y result, and map it to the bounds of the map (from -20 to 130) using an affine transformation and this becomes the y value of the block in the world. If the result of the above process is 7, we would use these results to generate a Block at (x=2, y=7, z=3). The idea is that you would iterate over every x and z value in a map and get back a value for y. If we create a world _just_ with Perlin Noise, this is the kind of map we get back.

![just perlin noise](../../assets/worldgen/just_perlin_noise.png)

Which is _fine_. Don't get me wrong, this is a fine map. This is essentially the [first dynamic map](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1848201246) that I made on the Steam workshop, but it wasn't really what I wanted. I wanted more flat lands and more steep hills, and a more dynamic way of styling the blocks instead of using a heightmap.

<a id="realistic-terrain"></a>
### Making more realistic terrain

We obviously can't use the Perlin Noise algorithm as-is, it produces too curved hills that don't work well for flat structures or steep mountains. To modify the algorithm, we apply some _math tricks_ (mostly taken from <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/maps/terrain-from-noise/">here</a>) in order to shape the result in the way we want. For flatter plains, we can for example simply clamp the result of Perlin Noise to return values only between 0-4. For mountains, we take the result of Perlin Noise _octave_ and raise it to an exponent (to creater sharper cliffs). For lakes, we only take the x-lowest y-values of the Perlin Noise result to get a unique lake shape. 

If you are more curious, you can take a peek in the source code to see what I did. Most of the values are customizable through the tool so you aren't constrained to the sizes of these features in your maps if you want something different.

<a id="bringing-it-together"></a>
### Bringing it together

Let me preface this and say this did not come to me immediately. In fact, this was over the course of many iterations that I figured out a process that worked well. The process the Game Builder world gen tool makes use of is **layering**. Here's what the tool does.

It first makes lakes, if specified.

![creating lakes](../../assets/worldgen/tutorial_creating_lakes.png)

Then, it makes the plains.

![lakes and plains](../../assets/worldgen/tutorial_lakes_plains.png)

Then the hills are next, if specified.

![lakes and plains and mountains](../../assets/worldgen/tutorial_lakes_plains_hills.png)

Last, mountains are created, if specified.

![everything in the map](../../assets/worldgen/tutorial_all_features.png)

Of course, in this process, blocks are colored based on the map's biome and constraints are placed on the blocks so we only are generating terrain within the limits of the game (-20 to 130).

<a id="installation"></a>

## <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHYGEhTWxTM">Installation (video)</a>
## Installation / usage

Go and download the .NET SDK <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/hello-world-tutorial/install">from this page</a>. (_Be sure to choose the OS you are on from the list to the left of the purple button!_)

![download net sdk](../../assets/worldgen/download_dotnet_sdk.png)

then...

### Windows users
Go and download the latest <a href="https://github.com/orangy/gamebuilder-plus/releases">Releases</a> zip folder. In this folder will be sub-folders for various systems. Download **all of the files** in the folder for your system (win-x64 most likely). Double-click on the .exe to run the application.

### Linux/OSX users
Go and download the latest <a href="https://github.com/orangy/gamebuilder-plus/releases">Releases</a> zip folder. In this folder will be sub-folders for various systems. Download **all of the files** in the folder for your system. Open up a terminal/console window in this folder containing the downloadable files. Run the following command to start the application:

```
dotnet .\GBWorldGen.Main.dll
```

<a id="usingit"></a>
## Using the tool

Starting the application, the window will look like this.

![console app main screen](../../assets/worldgen/console_app_main_screen.png)

You have a few options to choose from.

1. Default - default map generator, only select the map biome
2. Custom - can fully customize all values
3. Exit - exits the application

*The values for biome as of v2 are **G**rassland, **D**esert, and **T**undra.*

If you choose option 1 or 2, you will get presented options of the map you'd like to create. You can simply press the 'Enter' key to choose the default value selected.

![cli default options](../../assets/worldgen/cli_default_options.png)

You will have a number of additional values to customize if you choose option 2.

- Plain frequency - larger number means more hilly plains
- Has lakes - y/n if you would like lakes in your map
- Lake frequency - larger number means more (but smaller) lakes
- Lake size - larger number means larger lakes
- Has hills - y/n if you would like hills in your map
- Hill frequency - larger number means more (but smaller) hills
- Hill clamp - larger number means taller hills
- Has mountains - y/n if you would like mountains in your map
- Mountain frequency - larger number means more (but smaller) mountains
- Additional mountain size - larger number means taller mountains
- Has tunnels - y/n if you would like tunnels in your map
- Tunnel count - the maximum number of tunnels in your map
- Tunnel radius - the radius of the tunnels
- Tunnel length - how long the tunnels should be

<a id="sample-maps"></a>
### Sample maps
Here are some sample maps and the values that were used for each map.

![sample map 1](../../assets/worldgen/sample_map_1.png)
Map specs => (250x250) Biome: 'Grassland'. Plain frequency: '0.02'. Lake frequency: '0.005'. Lake size: '12'.

![sample map 2](../../assets/worldgen/sample_map_2.png)
Map specs => (250x250) Biome: 'Desert'. Plain frequency: '0.02'.  Hill frequency: '0.05'. Hill clamp: '75'.

![sample map 3](../../assets/worldgen/sample_map_3.png)
Map specs => (250x250) Biome: 'Tundra'. Plain frequency: '0.02'. Lake frequency: '0.015'. Lake size: '7'. Hill frequency: '0.028'. Hill clamp: '50'. Mountain frequency: '0.005'. Additional mountain size: '0.75'.

![sample map 4](../../assets/worldgen/sample_map_4.png)
Map specs => (250x250) Biome: 'Grassland'. Plain frequency: '0.02'. Lake frequency: '0.011'. Lake size: '7'. Hill frequency: '0.028'. Hill clamp: '50'. Mountain frequency: '0.065'. Additional mountain size: '0.65'.

<a id="options-json"></a>
### Using options.json

In order to quickly iterate in your map building, you can create an **options.json** file in the same directory as `GBWorldGen.Main.dll` (or GBWorldGen.Main.exe for you Windows users) to pre-fill the tool with default options for some choices. 

![options.json](../../assets/worldgen/options_json.png)

When you run the tool, the options file will be read to pre-fill choices for you. You can choose to fill out any or all of these fields as shown below.

```
{
    "width": "200",
    "length": "200",
    "saveTo": "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Game Builder\\GameBuilderUserData\\Games"
}
```

<a id="extra-advanced"></a>
### Extra advanced mode

No matter what environment (OS) you have, you can run the application via the terminal/console. Like in the Linus/OSX instructions, you can run the app by navigating to the folder containing `GBWorldGen.Main.dll` and run the following command.

```
dotnet .\GBWorldGen.Main.dll
```

If you get tired of the typewriter text effect in the application, you can run the application with the following command which will disable the typewriter effect.

```
dotnet .\GBWorldGen.Main.dll -- -fast
```

Another helpful tidbit is that you can create maps larger than 500x500 (the current largest size in Game Builder UI). Be warned as your game might freeze as it loads the generated map (as it is quite large). Creating anything smaller than 50x50 and the game crashes, so don't try.

<a id="playing-built-maps"></a>
## Playing built maps

Once you set up your **options.json** file to point to your directory where your maps are saved, you can run the tool and be able to see your maps in Game Builder right away.

![playing custom maps](../../assets/worldgen/playing_custom_maps.png)

If you are having trouble finding where your Game Builder maps are saved, right-click Game Builder in Steam and go to Properties, then click the Local Files tab. Select Browse Local Files...

![browse local files](../../assets/worldgen/browse_local_files.png)

You will want to get the path to the "Games" folder and stick it in the **options.json** file (as shown in the above options.json sample file).

![games folder](../../assets/worldgen/games_folder.png)

You can also hit `ctrl + alt + l` (that's a lowercase L) to bring up a window to select your `.voos` file directly and load that map right away if you are playing Game Builder. Just, make sure to pause your game `ctrl + p` if you are in a map before you do so, the game seems to crash more often if it isn't paused and you load a map through these means.

<a id="fixing-player-positions"></a>
### Fixing player positions

Very likely, you will spawn underneath the map the first time you load the map.

![spawning underground](../../assets/worldgen/falling_players_start.png)

This is because the y-values of the generated terrain are often above 0 with the maps the world gen tool creates. In order to not fall through the map, you will need to pause `ctrl + p` the game, and then reset the game `ctrl + r`.

For each player, move them out of the terrain and into the world. Once you do this, **Set to current** for each player so when the game is reset again, they will not spawn below the terrain again. 

**SAVE ONCE ALL PLAYERS' POSITIONS ARE FIXED!** (A friendly reminder)
